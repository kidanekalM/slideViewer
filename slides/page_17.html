                    The growth of Ethiopia’s e-commerce sector is significantly constrained by a lack of trust in
                    transactions between unfamiliar buyers and sellers. <strong>Escrow services are a standard mechanism
                    for mitigating this risk by having a neutral third party hold funds until the terms of a transaction
                    are met.</strong> However, the current regulatory environment presents two key obstacles to
                    implementing such a system. First, <strong>licensed Payment System Operators (PSOs) are not permitted
                    to establish and operate escrow accounts at commercial banks</strong>, preventing the development of this
                    critical trust-building infrastructure. Second, there is a fundamental misalignment between payment
                    settlement timelines, which are typically completed within two days (T+2), and e-commerce return
                    policies, which often allow for a seven-day window. This discrepancy means funds could be released to
                    a seller before a buyer’s return period has expired, undermining consumer protection.

                    <strong>Reviewing the existing regulatory framework is therefore essential.</strong> This will involve
                    considering developing clear guidelines to permit licensed PSOs to manage escrow accounts, establishing
                    robust risk management controls, and aligning settlement rules with commercial realities. <strong>By doing so,
                    this action will provide the necessary buyer-seller protection, reduce the risk of fraud, and build the
                    foundational trust required for a secure and thriving digital marketplace.</strong>
